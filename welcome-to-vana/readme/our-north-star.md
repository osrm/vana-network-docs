# Our North Star

Our north star is to empower users to own their data and the value it creates. We believe data will power the AI economic shift over the next decade. Giving users true ownership of their data opens up walled gardens and pushes AI progress forward through data abundance.

We apply the sovereign, decentralized technology that powers bitcoin and ethereum to personal data, shifting power from monopolistic big tech and distributing it back into the hands of the users who created the data. Vana provides the infrastructure to generate user-owned datasets that can replicate and supersede the datasets that big tech companies are today selling for hundreds of millions of dollars.

#### _**We’re creating the world's largest user-owned data treasury—a resource so valuable that the world’s leading AI models will be built upon it.**_
