# The Data Ownership Problem

We live under data serfdom, where we create valuable data and see no economic upside in the value we've helped create.

OpenAI_,_ Meta, and Google all train models on publicly scraped data from the searchable internet, and are starting to buy up private data as they need access to more training data. Reddit for example, earns $200M from selling user-generated content as AI training data. As AI starts to play a larger and larger economic role in society, the economic impact of this data will grow.&#x20;

We risk heading towards a future where AI models trained on our data displace us, with the economic gains flowing to a small set of shareholders. At the same time, we hold all the power through our data, but it requires collective action.

We believe that you should own a piece of the AI models that your data helps create.&#x20;
