# What is Data Liquidity Pool?

At Vana, we believe in a future where individuals **own** and benefit from the data they contribute. That’s why we built Data Liquidity Pools (DLPs) — a way for users to **monetize, control, and govern their data** in a decentralized ecosystem.

A DLP turns raw data into a **liquid asset**. Once contributed, your data can be shared, traded, or used to train AI models, all while you maintain control over how it’s used. Each DLP is a smart contract on the Vana blockchain that secures and governs data usage according to your preferences.

## DLPs as Consumer Apps in Vana’s Ecosystem

On Vana, DLPs are more than just data pools — they act like dataDAOs, similar to DAOs around dApps on other blockchains. Each DLP has its own token, allowing contributors and early adopters to benefit as the pool grows in value. Collectively, DLPs create a decentralized data marketplace.

Think of Vana as the home for these DLPs. It provides the infrastructure, the governance, and the decentralized mechanisms needed for DLPs to operate effectively and securely.

## Why Create or Join a DLP?

* **Monetize Your Data**: Earn ongoing rewards and governance tokens by contributing data, rather than letting big tech profit from it.
* **Own Your Data**: Stay in control — your data is only accessible according to the conditions your DLP set.
* **Shape AI’s Future**: Play a role in the development of AI models that reflect your values.
