# Run your personal server

Vana supports a non-custodial architecture in which users and data collectives can store private information off-chain. Personal servers allow users to store personal data and train models on their data in a secure local environments. Urbit and Solid Project were the first to pioneer similar architectures. Vana uses it specifically for private, personal data storage. To run your personal server, get started [here](https://github.com/vana-com/personal-server).&#x20;

Today, we offer two options for a personal server:

* Self-host on a Macbook (M1 chip or better required)
* Hosted application in partnership with Replicate
