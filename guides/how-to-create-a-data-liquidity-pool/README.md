# How to create a Data Liquidity Pool?

By following this guide, you’ll be able to scope, build, and launch a DLP to collect and monetize valuable data. Let’s break down the process into three key phases: [Scoping](stage-1-scoping.md), [Building](stage-2-building.md), and [Pre-launch](stage-3-pre-launch.md).

Vana’s network is competitive — only the top 16 DLPs earn rewards from the root network, based on data value and participation. This incentivizes quality, ensuring only the best pools rise to the top. Users can stake in specific DLPs, helping them secure a spot in the top 16, and they’ll earn a portion of the rewards as well. The top 16 DLPs share a [17.5% allocation](../../core-concepts/key-elements/incentives.md) of the total FDV during the first 2 years.

Good luck, and welcome to the future of the data economy.
