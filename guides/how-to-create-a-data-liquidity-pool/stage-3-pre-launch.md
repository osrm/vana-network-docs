  After building, you’ll want to prepare your DLP for launch. This phase is
  about integrating your DLP into the broader Vana ecosystem and getting the
  word out.

# Stage 3: Pre-launch

### **Step 1: Apply for the Telegram Mini App Pre-mined Campaign**

This exclusive opportunity is designed for early-stage DLPs to build awareness and traction ahead of your public launch. By participating, you’ll gain early access to potential users via our Telegram’s Mini app. If you’re interested in joining, reach out to us on Discord to get involved and receive additional support for your project.

### **Step 2: Integrate with DEX, Staking, and Governance**

Before your DLP goes live, ensure it’s integrated with Vana’s ecosystem for staking, decentralized exchanges (DEX), and governance. No need to worry—Vana provides all the necessary guides and tools to make the integration process straightforward. Additional documentation will be provided later.&#x20;

### **Step 3: Marketing and Community Building**

Building a DLP isn’t just about the tech. You'll need to get the word out to data contributors and consumers. Some questions to consider:

* **Who are your early adopters?** Are they individuals or companies?
* **How will you keep contributors engaged?** Consider loyalty programs, rewards, or other incentives.
* **Social Channels:** Use social media, forums, and industry groups to spread the word. Your presence will be key in bringing contributors and consumers on board.
