# Network information

## Testnet

The Vana network is a fully EVM-compatible L1 designed for private data. Currently in testnet, it is a testing ground for data liquidity pool creators and data contributors.

{% hint style="warning" %}
Our testnet is under active development. You may encounter bugs, performance issues, and other disruptions. Data on the testnet may be wiped without warning. \
\
We appreciate your feedback and contributions to help to resolve any issues. Please join our [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/Wv2vtBazMR) for the most up-to-date information.
{% endhint %}

### Terms of Service for Participation in the Testnet

{% hint style="info" %}
Please make sure to read carefully the [Terms](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1p45fQXiQUfIKi\_CmdLOGqlYigl4ZJiYC/view?usp=sharing) before you participate in any activities on Satori Testnet.
{% endhint %}

## Network Details

Add a new network with these details within your preferred wallet (e.g. MetaMask). The video below demonstrates how to do this.

### Moksha Testnet

Moksha is our current testnet, running on Proof-of-Stake consensus. This is the recommended testnet for active development.

<table data-header-hidden><thead><tr><th width="183"></th><th></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>RPC URL</strong></td><td>https://rpc.moksha.vana.org</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Chain ID</strong></td><td>14800</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Network name</strong></td><td>Vana Moksha Testnet</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Currency</strong></td><td>VANA</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Block Explorer</strong></td><td>https://moksha.vanascan.io</td></tr></tbody></table>

### Satori Testnet

Satori is our first testnet, running on Proof-of-Authority consensus. While we don't recommend this testnet for active development, it is available for historical purposes.&#x20;

<table data-header-hidden><thead><tr><th width="183"></th><th></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>RPC URL</strong></td><td>https://rpc.satori.vana.org</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Chain ID</strong></td><td>14801</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Network name</strong></td><td>Vana Satori Testnet</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Currency</strong></td><td>VANA</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Block Explorer</strong></td><td>https://satori.vanascan.io</td></tr></tbody></table>

### Setting up the Network

A quick video on setting up the Satori Testnet and perform a simple data transaction.

You will also find a button on the bottom left in the block explorer to add the network with one click to your MetaMask. If using mobile, you will need to use the MetaMask browser to see this button.

{% endhint %}

A block explorer is a web-based tool that allows users to view details about blocks, transactions, addresses, and other activities on a blockchain network. Block explorers provide a user-friendly interface for accessing blockchain data, making it easier to track transactions, monitor network activity, and verify information without needing to run a full node.

## Token Faucet

{% hint style="success" %}
Available at: [https://faucet.vana.org/](https://faucet.vana.org/)
{% endhint %}

To begin testing on Satori, use the faucet to send free tokens to your wallet so you can register a DLP or a validator node. The faucet is rate-limited, but if you need more tokens to test, send your wallet address in discord and the community will help you out.
